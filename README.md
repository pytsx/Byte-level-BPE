# Byte-level-BPE
This project uses Byte Level Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to train a tokenizer for natural language processing. The tokenizer is trained on a dataset of Wikipedia articles and can encode and decode text into a sequence of tokens. The trained model is saved as a JSON file for later use.
